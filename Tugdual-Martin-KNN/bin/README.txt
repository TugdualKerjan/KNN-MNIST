README:
Alright so I have no idea how to write a read me, but here is what I wanna say: 
I have attached to the project an extra package that I made, which contains a neural network.
This neural network learns to recognise the digits of the image database that was given, in general managing 
to get 98% accuracy!! I also have built a neural network meant for encoding the images and decoding them, compressing them to a 50 byte image instead of a 28x28 byte image, 
with 80% similarity between the output and input image, although I chose not to include this one into the final project, since it was badly written :P

RUNNING THE NEURAL NETWORK:
Simply execute the NeuralNetwork class, it will ask you for the learning rate (Choose around 0.1), the amount of layers of the network and the respective amount of neurons per layer.
A window will then pop up displaying the networks progress

!! The amount of images per second can be lowered by pressing the up arrow in the keyboard, and inversely with the down arrow !!

What the window shows is the network with the connections from each neuron. Blue means the connection is a negative weight, red means positive.
The output of each neuron is white if the output is low and black if the output is high.
